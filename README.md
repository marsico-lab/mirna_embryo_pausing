## Overview

This is the public repository for the bioinformatics analyses of the paper titled
"Combinatorial microRNA activity is essential for the transition of pluripotent cells from
proliferation into dormancy" by D Iyer, L Moyon et al.

The code will be progressively pushed from the private repository @ Helmholtz Munich from the 2023/10/19 to the 2023/10/24 (Lambert Moyon is currently travelling with limited remote access).

### Analyses code to upload

- [ ] miRNA-seq DEA (in vivo, in vitro)
- [ ] miRNA-seq DEA results processing (clustering and analyses)
- [ ] Proteomics DEA
- [ ] Multiomic network integration
- [ ] promoters motifs analysis
- [ ] cut&tag analysis

In addition, main data files will be added to ease indepedant reproducibility of each step:

- [ ] miRNA-seq logFCs values and clusters
- [ ] proteomics logFCs
- [ ] promoters
